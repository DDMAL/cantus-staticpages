# General guidelines

There are general guidelines for how this markdown text has to be written so that it is correctly rendered in the Cantus Ultimus website.

- All titles should use an 'h1' header tag, more precisely, the equivalent to a 'h1' header in `markdown`. For example
```
# This is correct title
```
- Titles should be short (<=30 characters), as they become part of the title and user interface of the website.
